initialize.sh initializes and runs the scripts on a node of a VM in a VMSS. It takes db credentials from the command line (specified by the user through the template) and stores them in credentials.py so that the scripts can use them. It then installs necessary components and starts the do_work.py script. do_work.py uses get_work to get a list of photo chunks from the db, compares them against the mini-photos in cifar-10 (only batch 1), then updates the database with the mini-picture numbers of the best-matching mini-pictures.

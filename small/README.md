Custom Image Provisioning Time By Size
======================================

This is a test of VMSS custom image provisioning time by size of custom image. It expects vhds at locations `~/data/nsglarge.vhd` and `~/data/nsgsmall.vhd`. The test is invoked with the command `sh run.sh <small|large>`. The test provisions 10 scale sets of 20 VMs each with overprovisioning on with the small/large image. These are all run in parallel in different regions with a randomly-seeded vmssName so that each run gets different resource names. The parameter files for the templates are stored in tmp/tmp&#42;.json; The output of the provisioning command is in tmp/out&#42;.json. This includes the output of the /usr/bin/time command, which only measures the time of the 'azure group deployment create' command. It does not check that the provision was successful. To get out the times, run `sh getResults.sh`. This will print out the provision times for the most recent run. It just parses what's in the tmp/ folder; when you run `sh run.sh`, the tmp/ folder will be emptied, and you will lose the data from the last run.
